					<h3>Mechatronics Project:</h3>
					<p style='text-align:justify;'>
						M/s. Capital Eco Systems has proposed to set up a small scale Common Hazardous waste Incineration Facility for thermal destruction of hazardous waste having characteristics of non-easily biodegradable/toxic/incinerable/combustible in nature. The incinerable waste may be in solid/ semi solid or liquid form.

The unit will be set up on an area measuring One Acre in industrially Notified Area at Chamarajanagar in Karnataka developed by Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board. All civic amenities and infrastructure facilities required for industrial developments are available. The industrial area is well connected by railways and by road.

As per the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, hazardous waste generated by industries has to be collected, transported, treated and disposed without causing any environmental damage. The disposal facility should be environmentally sound without causing any adverse impact on health and environment which may result from such waste. M/s.

Capital Eco Systems, proposes to collect Incinerable hazardous waste generated from industries for incineration in their proposed facility.

Incineration has benefit of reducing volume and toxicity of wastes. The proposed facility will have facility for Incineration designed to meet CPCB standards and will cater to environmentally and economically sound disposal of Hazardous waste generated. The proposed project is well justified in meeting the need of the industries located in the Chamarajanagar, Mysore, Hassan, Mandya etc.

The proposed project will have the following facilities: a) KSPCB approved Transport vehicle 2 Nos b) Secured Storage and sorting facility within the plant c) Incinerator of 500 kg/hr capacity with air pollution control equipment d) Effluent treatment and recycling facility e) DG set – 125 KVA
